# Transitioning For Companies
A list of companies and the steps needed to change your designations on the site related for transitioning. This guide is an attempt to categorize companies into difficulty levels, and promote awareness that many of the requirements are mostly just a burden and annoyance rather than for security.

# Designations
Here's a short (incomplete) list of things you may want to change on a site/service:
- Name
- Sex/gender
- Username
- Email address

# Typical Legal Documentation
- Current driver's license
- Utility bill
- Marriage license

# Contributing
Read and contribute to add your experience to the list!

To add a new item, open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/hahaluckyme/transitioning-for-companies/pull/new/master). If you need to break a company into two buckets, denote the designation in parentheses.

## Impossible (Cannot make changes)
- Gmail (email address) | Cannot change gmail email addresses. However, you can [add a non-gmail alternate email](https://myaccount.google.com/u/0/email) and then [delete your Gmail account](https://myaccount.google.com/u/0/dashboard) which will let you keep the rest of your Google account.

## Difficult (Requires supporting Legal Documentation)
- Chase | Requires Legal Document of new name
- [Delta Skymiles](https://www.delta.com/us/en/need-help/support-skymiles) | Requires copy of Legal Document with matching name on Skymiles account
- [HiltonHonors](https://help.hilton.com/s/article/How-do-I-change-my-name-on-my-account) | Requires current email address, phone number, reason for name change, copy of Legal Document with matching home address as the address in their system

## Hard (High effort or has many steps)

## Easy (May require a phone call)
- [Steam](https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpAccountDataQuestion) | Ask for a username change because of gender transition, then provide a [proof of ownership for the account](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2268-EAFZ-9762)

## Great (Trivial, only requires internet)
