# Transitioning For Companies
A list of companies and the steps needed to change your designations on the site related for transitioning. This guide is an attempt to categorize companies into difficulty levels, and promote awareness that many of the requirements are mostly just a burden and annoyance rather than for security.

# Designations
Here's a short (incomplete) list of things you may want to change on a site/service:
- Name
- Sex/gender
- Username
- Email address

# Typical Legal Documentation
- Current driver's license
- Utility bill
- Marriage license

# Contributing
Read and contribute to add your experience to the list!
